# Human-Activity-Reconviction-Sysytem

*Introduction*
-> What it is: This project uses machine learning to predict human activities such as walking, sitting, or standing based on sensor data.
-> Why it matters: HAR has applications in areas like health monitoring, fitness tracking, and improving human-computer interactions.
-> What it does: The pipeline processes raw sensor data, extracts meaningful features, trains a classification model, and predicts activity labels for new data inputs.
